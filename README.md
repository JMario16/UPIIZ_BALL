## Specifications:
* Language: Python (using the pygame and math libraries).
* Physics Application: Incorporate principles of kinematics, dynamics, work, and energy.

To provide direction and force for the shot, a joystick located at the center of the screen will be controlled with the mouse. The ball will be launched upon releasing the mouse click.

For each shot, the predicted parabolic trajectory of the ball will be graphically displayed using points, based on the joystick's movement. This trajectory will update at time intervals to optimize memory usage.

Earn 5 points for making a basket. Earn 10 points for maximizing the horizontal range (when θ = 45°). Points will decrease as time progresses.
